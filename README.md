ðŸš€ Showcasing My C++ Projects! ðŸš€

I've been working on several C++ projects to strengthen my programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what Iâ€™ve built:

ðŸ“Œ To-Do List Manager
A simple yet efficient console-based task manager that allows users to:
âœ… Add new tasks
âœ… Remove completed tasks
âœ… View the list of pending tasks
This project helped me understand file handling and interactive menu-driven programs in C++.

ðŸ“Œ Student Management System
A structured program that stores and manages student records, including:
âœ… Name, Roll Number, and Grades
âœ… Updating student details
âœ… Displaying student information
It reinforced my knowledge of data structures and structured programming.

ðŸ“Œ Library Management System
A real-world simulation of a library system that allows users to:
âœ… Add and remove books
âœ… Issue and return books
âœ… View available books
This project improved my understanding of handling user input and managing records.

ðŸ“Œ Unit Converter
A handy tool that performs conversions for:
âœ… Temperature (Celsius â†” Fahrenheit)
âœ… Length (Meters â†” Feet)
âœ… Weight (Kilograms â†” Pounds)
This project enhanced my skills in mathematical operations and input validation in C++.

Each of these projects helped me gain hands-on experience in C++ programming, user input handling, and interactive applications. Excited to keep building and learning! ðŸš€

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! ðŸ‘‡
